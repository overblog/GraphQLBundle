OverblogGraphQLBundle
======================

This Symfony bundle provides integration of [GraphQL](https://facebook.github.io/graphql/) using [webonyx/graphql-php](https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php)
and [GraphQL Relay](https://relay.dev/docs/en/graphql-server-specification).
It also supports batching using libs like [ReactRelayNetworkLayer](https://github.com/nodkz/react-relay-network-layer) or [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/link/apollo-link-batch-http/).

After installation
------------

Define your [GraphQL schema](definitions/index.md).

Symfony Flex installation
------------

**Note:** OverblogGraphQLBundle only supports Symfony Flex from version 0.9.0 onwards

**a)** Download the bundle

In the project directory:

```bash
composer require overblog/graphql-bundle
```

**b)** Accept the contrib recipes installation from Symfony Flex

```
-  WARNING  overblog/graphql-bundle (0.9): From github.com/symfony/recipes-contrib

    Do you want to execute this recipe?
    [y] Yes
    [n] No
    [a] Yes for all packages, only for the current installation session
    [p] Yes permanently, never ask again for this project
    (defaults to n): 
```

**c)** If you want to run GraphiQL interface we have a bundle:

 ```bash
 composer require --dev overblog/graphiql-bundle
 ```

Manual installation
------------

**a)** Download the bundle

In the project directory:

```bash
composer require overblog/graphql-bundle
```

**b)** Enable the bundle

```php
// in app/AppKernel.php
class AppKernel extends Kernel
{
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = [
            // ...
            new Overblog\GraphQLBundle\OverblogGraphQLBundle(),
        ];

        // ...
    }
}
```

**c)** Enable GraphQL endpoint

```yaml
# in app/config/routing.yml
overblog_graphql_single_endpoint:
    resource: "@OverblogGraphQLBundle/Resources/config/routing/single.yaml"
    prefix: /
```

To use multiple schemas:

```yaml
# in app/config/routing.yml
overblog_graphql_multiple_endpoint:
    resource: "@OverblogGraphQLBundle/Resources/config/routing/multiple.yaml"
    prefix: /graphql
```

Composer autoloader configuration (optional)
------------

Use composer `ClassLoader` to load generated class (optional but recommended)

Using composer ClassLoader will help keeping hand on loader optimization
in production environment...

First start by some configuration:

```yaml
overblog_graphql:
    definitions:
        # disable listener the bundle out of box classLoader
        use_classloader_listener: false
        # change to "false" to disable auto compilation.
        # To generate types manually, see "graphql:compile" command.
        auto_compile: true
        # change classes cache dir (recommends using a directory that will be committed)
        cache_dir: "/my/path/to/my/generated/classes"
        # Can also change the namespace
        #class_namespace: "Overblog\\GraphQLBundle\\__DEFINITIONS__"
```

then enable composer autoloader in project `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "Overblog\\GraphQLBundle\\__DEFINITIONS__\\": "my/path/to/my/generated/classes/"
        }
    }
}
```

Finish by dumping the new autoloader.

```bash
composer dump-autoload
```
