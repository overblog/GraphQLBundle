- To use the annotations, you must also install `doctrine/annotations`
- To use the annotations doctrine type guesser, you must also install `doctrine/orm`


Composer autoloader configuration (optional)
------------

Use composer `ClassLoader` to load generated class (optional but recommended)

Using composer ClassLoader will help keeping hand on loader optimization
in production environment...

First start by some configuration:

```yaml
overblog_graphql:
    definitions:
        # disable listener the bundle out of box classLoader
        use_classloader_listener: false
        # change to "false" to disable auto compilation.
        # To generate types manually, see "graphql:compile" command.
        auto_compile: true
        # change classes cache dir (recommends using a directory that will be committed)
        cache_dir: "/my/path/to/my/generated/classes"
        # Can also change the namespace
        #class_namespace: "Overblog\\GraphQLBundle\\__DEFINITIONS__"
```

then enable composer autoloader in project `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "Overblog\\GraphQLBundle\\__DEFINITIONS__\\": "my/path/to/my/generated/classes/"
        }
    }
}
```

Finish by dumping the new autoloader.

```bash
composer dump-autoload
```
